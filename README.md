# LuaClassLib
Extends the Lua C API to provide Moonscript-compatible class support, with or without Moonscript.

This library currently has a minimal cmake build configuration. Expanding this is the final major step towards a working release. For now, you can download and build the library and its tests using standard cmake syntax, but installation is not yet supported.

[Documentation](https://mousebyte.github.io/moonlib/) is available on Github Pages.
